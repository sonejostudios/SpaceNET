# SpaceNET
A Space Adventure

__Description:__

SpaceNET is a non-linear retro sci-fi adventure. Less graphics, more story! Along with an amazing soundtrack and a really atmospheric soundscape, the minimalist graphics allows a deeper immersion into the story.
You are flying peacefully with your spaceship and you get caught by a mysterious spaceship. You wake up in a prison cell and your memory is gone. You just remember a name: SpaceNET. But what is this?

Hint: Be prepared to save the universe!
